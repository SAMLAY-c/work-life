# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian knowledge vault focused on product management, business strategy, and educational technology. The workspace contains product requirements documents (PRDs), business frameworks, and improvement analyses for an educational platform called "锦书" (Jinshu).

## Directory Structure

- **`prd/`** - Product Requirements Documents for the Jinshu educational platform
- **`improvement_suggestions/`** - Systematic analyses and improvements for PRDs using the 3R framework
- **`advise/`** - Core product management methodology and thinking frameworks
- **`Business Mindset/`** - Business strategy frameworks (TTPPRC model)
- **`增长黑客/`** - Growth hacking knowledge and AARRR frameworks
- **`chuangye/`** - Entrepreneurship content (development area)
- **`.obsidian/`** - Obsidian vault configuration and plugins

## Core Frameworks

### Product Management Methodology (`advise/1.md`)
- **Core Philosophy**: "重思考轻PRD" (Think more, write less PRDs)
- **Key Principles**: Focus on problem identification, avoid "Agent" mentality, maintain 6-12 month architectural flexibility
- **Analysis Framework**: Challenge business requirements to identify real pain points

### Business Strategy (`Business Mindset/1.md`)
- **TTPPRC Model**: Trend → Traffic → Product → Package → Repurchase → Cost

### Growth Hacking (`增长黑客/1增长黑客知识汇总.md`)
- **AARRR Model**: Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral
- **Key Concepts**: PMF, Aha Moment, North Star Metric, ICE scoring

### Improvement Analysis (`improvement_suggestions/`)
- **3R Framework**: Rethink → Reframe → Rebuild
- **Quality Standards**: Systematic analysis of existing PRDs using product thinking principles

## Working with This Knowledge Base

### Content Analysis Pattern
When analyzing PRDs or product requirements:
1. Read the original PRD in `prd/` directory
2. Review corresponding improvement suggestion in `improvement_suggestions/`
3. Apply frameworks from `advise/1.md` for consistent product thinking
4. Reference business frameworks from `Business Mindset/` or `增长黑客/` as needed

### Document Creation Standards
- Use descriptive filenames with clear numbering (e.g., `01_`, `02_`)
- Include version history tables in PRDs
- Follow structured analysis format for improvement suggestions
- Create Excalidraw diagrams for complex concepts

### Cross-Referencing Patterns
- Documents systematically reference each other creating a knowledge graph
- Improvement suggestions link back to original PRDs
- Framework documents are applied consistently across analyses

## Language and Context

- **Primary Language**: Chinese (reflecting the Chinese education market focus)
- **Product Focus**: Jinshu educational platform features including course management, student reporting, broadcasting functionality
- **Documentation Style**: Structured analysis with practical application over theoretical concepts

## Key Architectural Insights

This knowledge base represents a systematic approach to product management in educational technology, with emphasis on:
- Quality-controlled requirement analysis
- Framework-based thinking patterns
- Continuous improvement methodologies
- Visual integration through diagrams and structured content
