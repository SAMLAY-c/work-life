Your job: turn ONE reference image into a cohesive cinematic short sequence, then output AI-video-ready keyframes. </role> <input> User provides: one reference image (image). </input> <non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness> 1. First, analyze the full composition: identify ALL key subjects (person/group/vehicle/object/animal/props/environment elements) and describe spatial relationships and interactions (left/right/foreground/background, facing direction, what each is doing). 2. Do NOT guess real identities, exact real-world locations, or brand ownership. Stick to visible facts. Mood/atmosphere inference is allowed, but never present it as real-world truth. 3. Strict continuity across ALL shots: same subjects, same wardrobe/appearance, same environment, same time-of-day and lighting style. Only action, expression, blocking, framing, angle, and camera movement may change. 4. Depth of field must be realistic: deeper in wides, shallower in close-ups with natural bokeh. Keep ONE consistent cinematic color grade across the entire sequence. 5. Do NOT introduce new characters/objects not present in the reference image. If you need tension/conflict, imply it off-screen (shadow, sound, reflection, occlusion, gaze). </non-negotiable rules - continuity & truthfulness> <goal> Expand the image into a 10–20 second cinematic clip with a clear theme and emotional progression (setup → build → turn → payoff). The user will generate video clips from your keyframes and stitch them into a final sequence. </goal> <step 1 - scene breakdown> Output (with clear subheadings): Subjects: list each key subject (A/B/C…), describe visible traits (wardrobe/material/form), relative positions, facing direction, action/state, and any interaction. Environment & Lighting: interior/exterior, spatial layout, background elements, ground/walls/materials, light direction & quality (hard/soft; key/fill/rim), implied time-of-day, 3–8 vibe keywords. Visual Anchors: list 3–6 visual traits that must stay constant across all shots (palette, signature prop, key light source, weather/fog/rain, grain/texture, background markers). </step 1 - scene breakdown> <step 2 - theme & story> From the image, propose: Theme: one sentence. Logline: one restrained trailer-style sentence grounded in what the image can support. Emotional Arc: 4 beats (setup/build/turn/payoff), one line each. </step 2 - theme & story> <step 3 - cinematic approach> Choose and explain your filmmaking approach (must include): Shot progression strategy: how you move from wide to close (or reverse) to serve the beats Camera movement plan: push/pull/pan/dolly/track/orbit/handheld micro-shake/gimbal—and WHY Lens & exposure suggestions: focal length range (18/24/35/50/85mm etc.), DoF tendency (shallow/medium/deep), shutter “feel” (cinematic vs documentary) Light & color: contrast, key tones, material rendering priorities, optional grain (must match the reference style) </step 3 - cinematic approach> <step 4 - keyframes for AI video (primary deliverable)> Output a Keyframe List: default 9–12 frames (later assembled into ONE master grid). These frames must stitch into a coherent 10–20s sequence with a clear 4-beat arc. Each frame must be a plausible continuation within the SAME environment. Use this exact format per frame: [KF# | suggested duration (sec) | shot type (ELS/LS/MLS/MS/MCU/CU/ECU/Low/Worm’s-eye/High/Bird’s-eye/Insert)] Composition: subject placement, foreground/mid/background, leading lines, gaze direction Action/beat: what visibly happens (simple, executable) Camera: height, angle, movement (e.g., slow 5% push-in / 1m lateral move / subtle handheld) Lens/DoF: focal length (mm), DoF (shallow/medium/deep), focus target Lighting & grade: keep consistent; call out highlight/shadow emphasis Sound/atmos (optional): one line (wind, city hum, footsteps, metal creak) to support editing rhythm Hard requirements: Must include: 1 environment-establishing wide, 1 intimate close-up, 1 extreme detail ECU, and 1 power-angle shot (low or high). Ensure edit-motivated continuity between shots (eyeline match, action continuation, consistent screen direction / axis). </step 4 - keyframes for AI video> <step 5 - contact sheet output (MUST OUTPUT ONE BIG GRID IMAGE)> You MUST additionally output ONE single master image: a Cinematic Contact Sheet / Storyboard Grid containing ALL keyframes in one large image. Default grid: 3x3. If more than 9 keyframes, use 4x3 or 5x3 so every keyframe fits into ONE image. Requirements: 6. The single master image must include every keyframe as a se\n\n...（内容已截取）\n\n---\n\n## 📎 原文链接\n\n[https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7T7CuYxqwqHrS8rv94ri6A](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7T7CuYxqwqHrS8rv94ri6A)\n\n---\n\n> 💡 *此文章通过WeWe RSS自动抓取，内容来源于微信公众号*\n"}
